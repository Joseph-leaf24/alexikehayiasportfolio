## **1. Data Analytics: Microsoft Power BI**

### **Tuberculosis Analysis in Zimbabwe using Microsoft Power BI**

Designed an interactive and data-rich Power BI dashboard to support public health decision-making by analyzing tuberculosis (TB) trends in Zimbabwe. 

The dashboard explores key metrics such as infection rates, gender and age distribution, and provincial case breakdowns, while also benchmarking Zimbabwe’s performance against neighboring countries in Southern Africa. This comparative analysis provides regional context for assessing the country’s progress in fighting TB and reveals cross-border public health dynamics.

The dashboard is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 – Good Health and Well-Being, specifically targeting the goal of ending the TB epidemic. It tracks Zimbabwe’s progress over multiple years, allowing users to measure improvement, detect setbacks, and identify underperforming areas requiring focused intervention. Additional features include customizable filters, time series visualizations, and integrated WHO indicators to ensure accuracy and global relevance.

This project demonstrates strong skills in health data analysis, regional benchmarking, and data storytelling—enabling stakeholders to derive actionable insights, allocate resources effectively, and enhance transparency in reporting health outcomes.

### **IKEA Dashboard For Card Skimming Detection**

Developed a comprehensive and security-focused Power BI dashboard to analyze and monitor the redeployment of payment terminals across IKEA Breda. 

This solution enables detailed tracking of terminal movements by both physical location and employee ID to uncover usage patterns, identify anomalies, and flag high-frequency redeployment zones that may signal operational inefficiencies or heightened skimming risk.

The dashboard incorporates key performance indicators such as total redeployments, frequency trends, employee-level deployment behavior, and compliance with IKEA’s mandatory twice-weekly terminal check protocol. 

Advanced visualizations help pinpoint "hotspot" areas within the store where terminals are frequently moved, facilitating deeper investigation and targeted action.

The tool not only enhances transparency and operational control but also supports proactive loss prevention, security compliance, and staff accountability. Custom filters and time-series visuals allow IKEA management to drill down into specific periods or departments, improving data-driven decision-making and aligning daily operations with broader store security strategies.

This project demonstrates advanced data storytelling, technical rigor, and a deep understanding of real-world retail challenges—particularly at the intersection of security, compliance, and customer transaction integrity.

## **2. Computer Vision**

### ** Image-Based Classroom Occupancy Detection (with Explainable AI)**

Developed image classification appliccation to detect classroom occupancy within universities. The core model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify whether classrooms are occupied or unoccupied using live camera feed imagery.

The solution is designed to reduce booking conflicts, optimise space usage, and enhance the user experience for students and staff.

To support transparency and ethical deployment, the model incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as Grad-CAM to visualize which parts of the image influenced model predictions. These visualizations confirm the model’s focus on relevant regions (e.g., seats, human figures), ensuring fair and trustable outputs.

The system was designed to integrate with BUas’s booking tools, provide real-time availability insights, generate usage analytics dashboards for facilities teams, and support sustainability efforts through better space utilization. A strong emphasis was placed on privacy-first design, ensuring anonymized data handling throughout the pipeline.

This project combined technical execution with real-world value, aligning AI implementation with stakeholder needs, sustainability goals, and responsible AI principles.

**Programming Languages/Tools**
1. Python.
2. OpenCV.
3. TensorFlow / Keras.
4. Matplotlib, Seaborn.
5. Grad-CAM (Explainable AI).
